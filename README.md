# Simulation_particle_on_path

PROBLEM STATEMENT :  Simulate trjectory of particle launched in earth gravity at a particular speed = u, and angle = theta, such that 
                     maximum height of trajectory = 45 and horizontal range of motion = 200.
                     Particle moves from landing point to launch point immediately upon landing, at 4 times the launch speed = 4u.
                     
Simulated using matplotlib library of Python3.
